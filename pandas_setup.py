# pandas is a python library built on top of numpy
# widely used in data analysis, data science and machine learning
# "pandas" comes from "panel data" (has nothing to do with the animal panda :( )
# we work with both series and data frames
# series: one dimensional labeled column
# data frame: two dimensional labeled grid/table

# with pandas we can import, display, manipulate and export data
# pythons microsoft excel (on steroids)

import pandas as pd

print(pd.__version__)
